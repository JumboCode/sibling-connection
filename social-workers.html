				<h1>I have a sibling group who would benefit from your programs, how do I make a referral?</h1>
				<p>First time referrals of sibling groups should be discussed directly with our program director, who will complete an intake form and will work with the referrer to obtain a release of information and permission form. Our program director will then contact the siblingsâ€™ caregivers to set up a time to meet them, either individually or in a group. Once it is determined that the siblings would be a good fit and would benefit from our programs they will be invited to the next Sibling Sunday activity where we will talk to them about Camp To Belong MA.</p>

				<h1>What is the purpose of the visit?</h1>
				<p>We like to visit all siblings who are referred to our programs for many reasons. We like to explain our programs directly to the siblings and their caregivers so they know what to expect and we want to ensure they are interested in our program. We want to assess their readiness to build upon their relationship their siblings. We assess each sibling for behavioral issues to understand if we will be able to manage those behaviors while the siblings are in our care. And finally, we want the siblings to meet somebody from our program so they will have at least one familiar face when they first attend one of our programs.</p>
