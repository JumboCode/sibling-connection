				<div class="description">
					<p>Since 2009, Eliza has been working with youth in libraries, group homes, and camp programs. During her time studying at Hamilton College, she became a camp counselor for kids with serious illnesses and has been hooked on camp programming ever since. Eliza has seen firsthand how these programs develop authentic and supportive relationships and is excited to bring her experience to Sibling Connections. In her free time, she enjoys dancing, gardening, and cooking spicy food.</p>
