			<p class="description">
				Phil is a graduate of Bentley College in Waltham, MA and was introduced to Sibling Connections through an outreach program at his prior employer, KPMG. Phil first became involved as a counselor at Camp To Belong in 2006. His belief in our program led him to recruit eight counselor volunteers and over $10,000 from his employer in the first year of his involvement. Throughout his time with Sibling Connections, he has been involved in many ways, ranging from camp planning to fundraising and strategic planning for the organization.
