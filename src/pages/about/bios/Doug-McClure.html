				Doug is a very proud dad of two daughters - one of whom was adopted from the foster care system in Massachusetts. His adopted daughter has also participated in Sibling Connections programs with several of her biological siblings. Those experiences have helped reinforce relationships that he knows she treasures. He has been a board member of Sibling Connections for several years and invites you to ask him how you can help kids in foster care.
