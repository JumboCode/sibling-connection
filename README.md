# Sibling Connections Website Redesign
Since 2005, [Sibling Connections](http://www.siblingconnections.org/) has maintained and strengthened the family bond between countless siblings separated by the public foster care system. In order to encourage potential donors, volunteers, social workers, and orphanages to get involved, JumboCode will be redesigning the current website in order to convey the vibrant, professional, and experienced organization that Sibling Connections is today.

## Client Information
From Sibling Connections:
> “The primary goal of Sibling Connections is to support the creation of enduring family relationships and community connections for sisters and brothers who experience foster care. Our work is accomplished through innovative programs and practices that restore and strengthen the lives of siblings who have been separated when placed in the public foster care system.”

#### Project Management

## Build Status
The front-end of the project is nearly complete. Work still needs to be done - we need to make certain elements more consistent across all pages, ensure a seamless responsive design across all screen size, and polish the design and code as a whole. Furthermore, Sibling Connections requested an easy-to-use "back office" that will allow them to add/edit events and photographs. This feature still needs to be implemented. We had originally planned to simply rework and incorporate the backend from the project JumboCode completed for the [Boston Institute for Nonprofit Journalism](https://medium.com/binj-reports). However, we may forgo this plan in favor of creating a new JumboCode project that will produce this backend from scratch. The plan for the backend will be finalized after consulting with both the JumboCode executive board and Sibling Connections.
