# Sibling Connections Website Redesign
Since 2005, Sibling Connections has maintained and strengthened the family bond between countless siblings separated by the public foster care system. In order to encourage potential donors, volunteers, social workers, and orphanages to get involved, JumboCode will be redesigning the current website in order to convey the vibrant, professional, and experienced organization that Sibling Connections is today.

## Client Information
From Sibling Connections:
> “The primary goal of Sibling Connections is to support the creation of enduring family relationships and community connections for sisters and brothers who experience foster care. Our work is accomplished through innovative programs and practices that restore and strengthen the lives of siblings who have been separated when placed in the public foster care system.”

## Build Status
Our project is nearly complete. While work still needs to be done in order to polish the website and make it completely responsive across all devices, almost all the front end has been finished. Furthermore, we need to rework and incorporate the backend from the BINJ project to fit the needs our client.
