			<p class="description">
				Susan joined the board in 2013 and became Board Chair in 2016. She spent 22 years in a variety of operational roles at Biogen Inc. Her most recent positions were VP of Global Supply Chain and Head of Global Quality and Compliance. After Leaving Biogen, she consulted for the biotech industry before deciding to stay home and raise her three young children. After becoming a mother, Susan realized how critical sibling relationships are to a childâ€™s emotional well-being. She is passionate about supporting Sibling Connections to help children in the foster care system develop positive relationships with their siblings.
